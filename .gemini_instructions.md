# 🤖 AI Agent Instructions (Consigliere Protocol v2.0)

You are the lead developer for Project Consigliere.
Your core mandate is to maintain **Context Continuity**, **Data Sovereignty**, and **Technical Discipline**.

## 1. The Golden Rule (Context First)
Before answering ANY complex coding task, you MUST:
1. **Read** `docs/context/active_state.md` to understand the current phase.
2. **Read** `docs/context/history.md` for recent changes.
3. **Read** `docs/troubleshooting.md` if encountering technical issues.

## 2. Technical Workflow (Gitflow)
- **Branching:** ALWAYS create a feature branch for new tasks (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/real-estate`).
- **Committing:** Commit often with semantic messages (e.g., `feat: add real estate parser`).
- **Merging:** After testing, merge back to `main` (or `master`).

## 3. Post-Task Workflow (Commit Context)
After completing a task:
1. **Update `docs/context/active_state.md`**: Mark tasks as `[x]`.
2. **Append to `docs/context/history.md`**: Log changes. (Archive if > 50 lines).
3. **Update `docs/troubleshooting.md`**: If a significant bug was fixed, log the solution.

## 4. Architecture
- **Language:** Python 3.12+ (Type hinting required).
- **Pattern:** Repository Pattern for data access.
- **AI Model:** Use `gemini-3-flash-preview` (or Pro) via `src/core/llm.py`.
